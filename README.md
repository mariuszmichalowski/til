# Home(ish) for Things I've Learned

Well, hello there!

I'm Justin, and this site is a place I use to jot down things that I think are interesting, new to me, or stuff I just recently learned that I want to remember!

If you want to get in touch, you can find my info here: [https://about.me/justinploegert](https://about.me/justinploegert)
